# CGPA Calculator

## Project Overview

This CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) Calculator is a program designed to compute the CGPA of multiple students based on their performance in various subjects. The program prompts the user to input information such as student names, IDs, and subject details, including names, marks, and credit hours. The CGPA is then calculated, and a merit list is generated.

## Tools Used

- C programming Language
- Visual Studio Code Studio

## Program Launch

The program begins by prompting the user to input the number of students (m). For each student, the program collects information about their name, ID, and the number of subjects (n). Subsequently, the details for each subject are recorded, including subject name, marks, and credit hours.

### Program Structure

The program is organized into two main structures: student and subject. The student structure contains information about the student, such as name and ID, while the subject structure stores details about each subject, including subject name, marks, credit hours, and calculated results.

### Student Structure

The student structure contains information about the student, such as name and ID.

### Subject Structure

The subject structure stores details about each subject, including subject name, marks, and credit hours.

## CGPA Calculation

The program calculates the CGPA for each student based on the entered information. It assigns grades to marks within specific ranges, multiplies the obtained grade by the credit hours for each subject, and computes the final CGPA by dividing the total sum of grade-point multiplications by the total credit hours. IIUC follows the uniform Grading System for evaluating academic performance.

### Formula

CGPA = (Σ(GP * Credit Hours)) / ΣCredit Hours

## Sample Output

The program produces detailed outputs for each student, including their name, ID, subject-wise performance, total credit hours, and CGPA. The merit list provides an organized view of students' performance, highlighting those with higher CGPA.

### Merit List

After computing the CGPA for all students, the program generates a merit list by sorting the students in descending order based on their CGPA.
